        <p>
          For Walker Street, the owner had already put together a template for the website, but I was brought on to create a new one within the span
          of a couple weeks. As such, I thought the easiest way to tackle this project was to take a lot of aspects of the original template -
          colours, fonts, atmosphere - and re-use them in a slightly new way for the template I would design.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I drew inspiration from horror and thriller aesthetics, and attempted to create a lot of visual cohesion by adding grain to all the images,
          and make them black and white, or black and red, which were the main three colours of the site's original design.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          My biggest regret for this template was that I did not originally create it with the intent to make it reponsive, and as such, the design
          remains static despite screensize. This means that once I finished majority of the design, it was then that I decided to go back and adjust
          to all for responsivity, but as the project was shut-down before I finished, it was never made fully responsive.
