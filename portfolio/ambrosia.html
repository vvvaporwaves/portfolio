        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from aspects and images from Greek mythology and witchcraft - such as gems, flowers and animals - the goal with
          Ambrosia's design was to create something that evoked a sense of magical fantasy.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          However, due to the brand's pre-established style, there were certain aspects - such as font and some colours - that I was asked to use to
          keep brand coherency and visual familiarty for users as we migrated from the previous website template.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          To bring this design to life, I worked with the owners of the website and gained experience communicating with clients and trying to balance
          their vision with my own. As well, as I worked with another coder and designer for the early part of the project, I also gained experience
          in the realm of leading, managing, and organizing a project between two people.
