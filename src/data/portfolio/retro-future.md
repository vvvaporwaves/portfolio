Retro Future was made as a proof of concept, with the design drawing inspiration from the sci-fi genre, with an interstellar atmosphere and setting. The colours were inspired by the music video for "Sour Candy" by Lady Gaga and BLACKPINK, which also includes otherworldly and sci-fi aspects, and very vibrant colours which I wanted to channel into this project.

As this was a proof of concept more than anything, this template is not friendly most screensizes. However, the process of designing for a horizontal layout, and finding the tools to make it possible on a mouse's scrollwheel were an interesting challenge to overcome.

In specific, designing a horizontal layout was fun as it required me to challenge my preconceptions about how the website would lay. As well, taking into consideration how users would interact with it was a large part of this drafting process.

I chose to view this as important because horizontal scrolling is not something most users would be familiar with, which is why the concept has a links in the quick navigation that are meant to anchor to each section of the site to allow for easy navigation for users.
