The design for FIREâœ½FLOWER was heavily inspired Memphis design, which was popular in the 90s, as well as browser windows and retro webpages. This was also the choice behind the usage of a custom mouse browser on desktop browsers. By taking inspiration from popular design and internet trends in the 90s and early 2000s, my goal was to build a design that inspired a sort of nostalgia, or visual reference to the time period.

With this in mind, I also wanted to create a template for the site that differed from the previous design. Therefore, I chose to go for a brighter colour scheme, but still keep things such as navigation, icons, and the general layout of the design similar to the previous one. This variety in design also allowed for users to have a little more freedom to pick which template suited their own visual needs, to a degree.

A big difference in the design process between the first and the second was the timefram in which I was both coding and designing the templates. The first template was done prior to the website's launch, while the second was done after. This means that for the second template, there were active users - outside of the owners - who used the site now.

This allowed me to reach out to our users for feedback and suggestions on what design aspects did, or did not work for them. Though not all suggestions were taken, it was an informative experience, and allowed me to gain more experience when it comes to the process of incorporating feedback into my design process. As well as, helped me determine what kind of things our userbase enjoyed visually, wanted to see more, and didn't like for future designs.
