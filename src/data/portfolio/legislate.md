**Legislate.me is a mobile app prototype made with the intent of creating a centralized place for Canadians to look up and gather information about bills being passed – or that have passed – on all levels, from municipal to federal.**

### Challenges

1. Centralize information and updates on local and federal government bills
2. Help users streamline research into bills
3. Offer explanations to help users understand proposed and passed government bills

## Research

### Examining competition (Competitive Audit)

In the domain of government bills and text, there are some companies and apps that exist to help their audiences better understand ongoing, or recently passed, bills. However, the ones specialized in this realm are often **paid and business-orientated** , meaning they aren't advertised or accessible to the average individual.

Often, they offer services that include AI generated summaries mixed with advice from legal professionals, and specifically aim to help businesses take preventative action when it comes to new bills.

On the other hand, while there are many free-to-use summarization tools online, and even AI-backed ones such as ChatGPT, they are often plagued with character limits, or require users to copy and paste text directly into their text boxes to start the summarization process.

### Preliminary Interviews

I conducted interviews with five young adults, ranging from early 20s to 30, all with varying levels of political activity, and legal knowledge and familiarity.

The **standout observation** I made during the interview process with these primary users was that **majority of them preferred to do their own research** and expressed **wanting to see as many sides of a story as possible** before coming to their own conclusions.

As well, many of them noted that **social media** , and **information shared via word-of-mouth** played a large role in their information gathering and research.

### Modeling

Based off of the interviews, the clearest picture of a primary user was **someone who wants to know more, but doesn't know where to start** when it comes to bills and the process behind passing them. With this knowledge in mind, I created three user personas to cover a wide range of potential users who may fall into this category.

#### Interview Insights

- All preferred to read text on mobile devices
- Many mentioned being able to share information as important to them
- Many mentioned wanting to do their own research, and find information from different sources

#### Defining app requirements

A big factor in the creation of this project was **scope and size** , which were both kept small as this was meant to be a single person project. I had to be specific when it came to the app requirements, and this required me to keep the functionality to a bare minimum.

For me, based off the interviews I did, looked like this:

- Bills are easy to read.
- Mobile first
- Shareable
- Can provide resources for expanding knowledge.

### Framework, Wireframing and Refinement

Before the wireframing process and with the app requirements in mind, I laid out the **information architecture** to help lay out the user flow and manage the number of screens I was planning to create.

With the architecture laid out, I started the iteration process for the screen designs by designing multiple options per screen, and then selecting the aspects that I believed best suited the app's goals.
