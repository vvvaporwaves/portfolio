## A False Start

As part of a 3-day design challenge, my first action was to jump straight into designing. I felt a level of pressure due to the tight time constraint and didn't want to misuse any of the time I had to complete it.

However, as time passed on the first day, I found myself with too many ideas and not enough focus to truly move forward.

From there, I reconcilled with myself: rushing into design wasn't going to do me any good if I didn't have a foundation to build off of. 3 days was not a lot of time, so I broke it down into chunks and planned accordingly to ensure I made the most of it.

## Research & Audit

With my timeline sorted, I began creating the materials I would need for the first step.

First, I created a short, informal survey to send out. The survey revolved around asking users on their associations with coffee, and artisan goods, which were the main two descriptors for the brand.

After the survey was created and sent out, I proceeded to conduct a small audit to see what the comptition looked like in the industry. I just briefly looked over four competiting coffe brands to see what they were offering, how they presented themselves, and to what audiences.

### Survey Results

Once I'd finished up with the competitive audit, I went through the results I'd recieved and sorted the comments recipients had answered with, putting similar answers together to **identify common patterns and associations** they had.

I'd also asked that - if they were interested in speaking with me further - they leave a way to reach them outside of the survey, and a few people had, so I contacted them to conduct a series of casual interviews to discuss their answers more.

## Brainstorming

With the results and information I'd gathered, I begane the brainstorming process. This involved moodboarding and brainwriting, where I used the initial impressions and terms the users had given me as a baseline to work outwards to help define brand colours, font and overall aesthetic.

### Brand Identity in Font Choice

I spent a signifigant amount of time on font choices. This is because the challenge included creating a wordmark for the brand's logo, so I know right from the start **fonts would play a big part in portraying the correct visual identity** for this brand.

In the end, I decided on [font name] because it balanced **readability with the handmade aesthetic** very easily. A lot of hand-written fonts wouldn't be readable at small sizes, and more typewriter-esque fonts looked too robotic or aged for the visual identity I wanted to curate for Artisanal Coffee Roastery.

## Iteration

### Wireframing

As I usually do, I thumbnailed multiple layouts and designs for Artisanal's homepage before picking out the parts of each thumbnail that I thought would work best in the final design.

From there, I laid out the final plans for the layout, and started gathering the materials I would need for the final design.

### Colour Choices

Based on the feedback recieved during my interviews, I wanted to draw inspiration from the keywords the users submitted. With this in mind, I began creating a small moodboard to brainstorm possible environments to draw from, and colour combinations to start off with.

From there, I refined and narrowed the colours to come up with the colour scheme displayed in the design now.

## Production

Once the colours, images, and layout were sorted, I moved into production. All photo editing was done in Photoshop, while the layout and actual web development was done in Figma over the course of the final day before submission.

I began with the desktop view first because I find it easier to scale down than to scale up, and once the initial design was complete, moved into creating a few different versions for common mobile devices.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project taught me a lot about the importance of narrowing scope, especially in the beginning. Obviously not as in-depth as other projects, it was a good exersize in research and development, and a good way to keep my skills from getting rusty.

Like most projects, there is still a great deal of expansion that can happen with this concept. In the future, I think I'd like to take this style into a mobile food ordering app, or expand the possible userflows for the desktop website.
