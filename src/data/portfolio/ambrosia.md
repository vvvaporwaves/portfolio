<div class="section">

Drawing inspiration from aspects and images from Greek mythology and witchcraft - such as gems, flowers and animals - the goal with Ambrosia's design was to create something that evoked a sense of magical fantasy.

However, due to the brand's pre-established style, there were certain aspects - such as font and some colours - that I was asked to use to keep brand coherency and visual familiarty for users as we migrated from the previous website template.

To bring this design to life, I worked with the owners of the website and gained experience communicating with clients and trying to balance their vision with my own. As well, as I worked with another coder and designer for the early part of the project, I also gained experience in the realm of leading, managing, and organizing a project between two people.
