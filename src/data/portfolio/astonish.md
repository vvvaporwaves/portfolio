 For Astonish, the goal was to create a dark and cold atmosphere on the site, which would then allow for the location boards - where majority of the colour is focused - to stand out more.

I took this approach for the design, in inspiration of the art used for the banner - by Yashiro Nanaco. Her artwork is often set against a dark background, but the images and characters she paints are incredibly vibrant and colourful, and I wanted to attempt to bring some of that style into the website template to match.

This particular template was one that went through many iterations prior to the design I - and the owners - settled on, which provided me with a lot of experience it comes to better encorperating feedback into my iterative design process. As well, it taught me to be more flexible with the design process, when working with others.

As well, this was my first attempt to fully build a responsive template, with the use of Tailwind and Sass.
