Summer Days was heavily inspired by summer time, as can be seen in the choice of bright, warm and vibrant colours. It was also made as a way to experiment, and become more familiar, with Bootstrap 5, as it was a recreation of a previous design I did that wasn't originally made to responsive.

Through this experiment, I was able to gain much-needed experience navigating Bootstrap 5. The hardest part of the journey was getting used to Bootstrap's container grid system, as well as its naming conventions. However, once I became more familiar with them, it became much easier to build a much more flexible template.
